===============
Sybase isql based - brower UI

i.e., Browser based database and table querying tool for Sybase written in Perl-CGI.

- Display is more readable compared to “isql”, which is a command line tool to access databases

- Forming a query just involves couple of mouse clicks and no keyboard touch is required

- Auto login within the network

- Adding a new database server entry is just one line config file change

- Reusable in any other RDBMS systems with less/no configuration changes

- Any developer can benefit from this tool and this can help in reduce the development time.

- This tool transforms the system level database operations to application level user clicks.

- By using this tool, database operations will no longer be command line operations.
