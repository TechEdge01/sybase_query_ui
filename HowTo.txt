How To INSTALL:

  - Copy the files into your Apache (either by check-out or by downloading the zip verion)
  - This one intends to run on localhost:8009, if your host/port varies, just replace the same
  - In left.cgi, just configure your available servers
  - In config.txt, just provide your username and password
  - Thats it... You are ready to go....


Not Working?? [Possible reasons could be]

  - Check your httpd.conf file to see the directories entries and permission to run CGI
  - Check your Perl path
  - Check all the linux commands works fine / defined in your PATH (grep, cut etc)
  - Just check from command line 'isql -s <server> -u <user> -p <passwd>' and if connects fine, this should also work.
